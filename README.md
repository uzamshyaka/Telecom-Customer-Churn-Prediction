Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict customer churn in the telecom sector. Customer churn refers
to when subscribers stop using a company’s services. Accurately identifying customers 
at risk of leaving helps telecom providers reduce losses and improve retention.

🔑 Project Overview
The dataset includes features such as call minutes, charges, international calls, 
and customer service interactions. The target variable is Churn (Yes/No).

The project covers:
Data Preprocessing – cleaning, feature selection, and scaling
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – visualizing correlations and churn patterns
Model Training – applying K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to predict churn
Evaluation – accuracy score, confusion matrix, classification report, cross-validation
Feature Selection – testing full features vs. top 5 features

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

🎯 Goal
The goal is to provide a practical tool that telecom companies can use to predict churn early and take action, 
such as targeted offers, better customer support, or improved service quality.
